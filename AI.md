# iP.AI

Tools used: VSCode Copilot with GPT Codex, Claude Opus and ChatGPT.

Used for:
- Code review and debugging
- Code documentation (Readme, JavaDocs, etc.)
- JUnit test cases generation

Interesting Observations:
- Copilot is very good at generating code snippets and can often complete
entire functions based on a few lines of code. However, it can sometimes
produce incorrect or suboptimal code, so it's important to review its
suggestions carefully.
- JUnit test case generation with AI can be very helpful, especially for
edge cases that might be overlooked. It also saves a massive amount of
time in writing boilerplate test code.
